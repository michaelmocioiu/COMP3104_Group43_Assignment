The Importance of Developer Operations (DevOps) in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC has many important facets, this document will cover how DevOps fit into it. 

1. Continuous Integration (CI)
  - Automates the process of merging code changes from multiple users, ensuring codebase integrity
2. Improves Product Quality
  - Rigorous improved + automated monitoring processes ensure a more stable product, reducing chances of bugs.
3. Increased Efficiency
  - Less labour required to maintain codebase -> better usage of developer time and skills.
4. Scalability
  - Allows development teams to adapt better to changing business and market conditions/needs.
5. Less Errors
  - Early bug detections which prevent codebase damage ensures that there will be less errors raised.
6. Improved Collaboration
  - Improves collaboration between teams that might otherwise might not have as much access to one another.

In conclusion, it is clear how important DevOps are to the SDLC, and without them, businesses would face more hardships and incur more losses.
