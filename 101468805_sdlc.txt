Part 1: Importance of DevOps in Software Development
    DevOps integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops)
    to enhance collaboration, efficiency, and automation throughout the software development lifecycle.
    By fostering a culture of communication between development and operations teams, DevOps helps accelerate
    the delivery of high-quality software. It emphasizes continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD),
    and monitoring, allowing faster updates and reducing the risk of errors in production.
